# <Text-Editor>

## Description

This application is able to let you give direct input, save it even when offline andhard refreshed and also allows you to install. It was built with the intention of correctly using PWA to save/install the web, allow offline access, and correctly use the PWA database. It solves the problem of coders needing somewhere to log important info, code snippets and more when out and abut of have a spur of the moment thought. Since its so easy to download onto your phone this can solve that issue! I learned about the difference of versions between databases and about new errors ive never experienced before (for example codemirror) which required some looking into.
